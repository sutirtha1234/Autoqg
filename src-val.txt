SOS as such the european court of justice is bound to draw inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the member states . EOS
SOS therefore , the european court of justice can not uphold measures which are incompatible with fundamental rights recognised and protected in the constitutions of member states . EOS
SOS none of the original treaties establishing the european union mention protection for fundamental rights . EOS

SOS the dialect of newcastle is known as geordie , and contains a large amount of vocabulary and distinctive word pronunciations not used in other parts of the united kingdom . EOS
SOS the geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the anglo-saxon populations who migrated to and conquered much of england after the end of roman imperial rule . EOS
SOS this language was the forerunner of modern english ; but while the dialects of other english regions have been heavily altered by the influences of other foreign languages -- particularly latin and norman french -- the geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language . EOS
SOS an example of this is the pronunciation of certain words : " dead " , " cow " , " house " and " strong " are pronounced " deed " , " UNK " , " UNK " and " UNK " -- which is how they were pronounced in the anglo-saxon language . EOS
SOS other geordie words with anglo-saxon origins include : " UNK " -lrb- from the anglo-saxon " UNK " , meaning " teach " -rrb- , " burn " -lrb- " stream " -rrb- and " gan " -lrb- " go " -rrb- . EOS

SOS this combination of mhc and antigen attracts a matching helper t cell , which releases UNK and activates the b cell . EOS
SOS when b cells and t cells are activated and begin to replicate , some of their offspring become long-lived memory cells . EOS
SOS this is " adaptive " because it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges . EOS
SOS immunological memory can be in the form of either passive short-term memory or active long-term memory . EOS
SOS throughout the lifetime of an animal , these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again . EOS
SOS newborn infants have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection . EOS
SOS during pregnancy , a particular type of antibody , called UNK , is transported from mother to baby directly across the UNK , so human UNK have high levels of antibodies even at birth , with the same range of antigen UNK as their mother . EOS
SOS breast milk or UNK also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies . EOS
SOS this passive immunity is usually short-term , lasting from a few days up to several months . EOS
SOS hormones can act as UNK , altering the sensitivity of the immune system . EOS

SOS conversely , some hormones are regulated by the immune system , notably thyroid hormone activity . EOS
SOS this means that they get less sun and therefore produce less UNK via uvb radiation . EOS
SOS the main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer t cells , sometimes with the assistance of helper t cells . EOS
SOS nk cells also kill UNK cells in a similar way , especially if the tumor cells have fewer mhc class i molecules on their surface than normal ; this is a common phenomenon with tumors . EOS
SOS tumor antigens are presented on mhc class i molecules in a similar way to viral antigens . EOS

SOS unlike animals , plants lack phagocytic cells , but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant . EOS
SOS individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as UNK molecular patterns or UNK . EOS
SOS when a part of a plant becomes infected , the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response , whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid UNK to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant . EOS
SOS systemic acquired resistance -lrb- UNK -rrb- is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent . EOS
SOS rna silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication . EOS
SOS UNK immune responses comprise the other end of immune dysfunction , particularly the autoimmune disorders . EOS
SOS here , the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and non-self , and attacks part of the body . EOS
SOS one of the functions of specialized cells -lrb- located in the thymus and bone marrow -rrb- is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced throughout the body and to eliminate those cells that recognize UNK , preventing UNK . EOS
SOS under normal circumstances , many t cells and antibodies react with " self " peptides . EOS

SOS bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier , for example , by using a type ii secretion system . EOS
SOS alternatively , using a type iii secretion system , they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell , providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host . EOS

SOS galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and UNK were both rolled down an UNK to disprove the aristotelian theory of motion early in the 17th century . EOS
SOS he showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force , for example friction . EOS
SOS newton 's first law of motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force or resultant force . EOS
SOS this law is an extension of galileo 's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force -lrb- see a more detailed description of this below -rrb- . EOS
SOS newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium " natural state " in place of the aristotelian idea of the " natural state of rest " . EOS
SOS by making rest physically indistinguishable from UNK constant velocity , newton 's first law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative UNK . EOS
SOS in other words , to phrase matters more technically , the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference , that is , in all frames related by a galilean transformation . EOS
SOS for instance , while traveling in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity , the laws of physics do not change from being at rest . EOS
SOS this is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle . EOS
SOS from the perspective of the person in the car , the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest : it is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction . EOS
SOS inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest . EOS
SOS the concept of inertia can be further generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion , even those that are not strictly constant velocity . EOS
SOS the rotational inertia of planet earth is what fixes the UNK of the length of a day and the length of a year . EOS
