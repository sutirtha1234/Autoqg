SOS however , while whitehead saw religion as beginning in solitariness , he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual . EOS
SOS in keeping with his process metaphysics in which relations are primary , he wrote that religion UNK the realization of " the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the UNK of its component individuals . " EOS
SOS in other words , the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the UNK of each individual entity to all the others -- meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone , but only in the context of the universal community . EOS
